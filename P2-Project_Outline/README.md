### Overview
SeeSpot is an app that aims to track the daily walks of your beloved pet! Users can record the distance and date/time of walks, as well as keep a log of bathroom stops. SeeSpot is a great way to track lasting memories with your pet, keep track of walks that others have taken your pet on, or great for dog walkers to record activities for their owners! Users can also add notes about their pets temperaments, moods, behavior, or anything else! The idea came from a place of frustration when we found ourselves talking more about our dogs walks and bowel movements than about our days. SeeSpot takes the guessing out of your dog's day, and brings owners and their pets one walk closer together.
